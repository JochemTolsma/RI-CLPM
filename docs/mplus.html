<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>For Mplus <span class="citation">(Muthén L. K. and Muthén 2017)</span> to work properly, make sure that you save the input file with the model specification (<em>example.inp</em>) in the same folder as the data (<em>example.dat</em>). You can download the simulated example datasets <a href="https://github.com/ellenhamaker/RI-CLPM/tree/master/data">here</a>. Mplus includes defaults, like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>observed and latent exogenous variables are correlated, and</li>
<li>residuals of observed and latent outcome variables (which do not predict anything) in a path model are correlated.</li>
</ul>
<p>These defaults are included to make the specification of many standard SEM models easier, but they are not always useful in the current modeling context. Therefore, we use the command <code>ANALYSIS: MODEL = NOCOV;</code> to overrule these defaults for the covariances and set all of them to zero.</p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="the-ri-clpm" class="section level2 tabset tabset-fade">
<h2>The RI-CLPM</h2>
<p>To specify the RI-CLPM we need four parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>between</em> part, consisting of the random intercepts. It is specified using the <code>BY</code> command, <code>RIx BY x1@1 x2@1 ...;</code>, where <code>@1</code> fixes the factor loading to one.</li>
<li>A <em>within</em> part, consisting of within-unit fluctuations. It is also specified using the <code>BY</code> command, <code>wx1 BY x1; wx2 BY x2; ...</code>. We do not have to constrain the factor loading to 1, as this is already the default in Mplus for the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable. However, we do need to constrain the measurement error variances to zero, as Mplus will include them by default when we use the <code>BY</code> statement. We do this by including <code>x1@0 x2@0 x3@0 x4@0 x5@0;</code> where <code>@0</code> fixes the measurement error variances to zero, which is the same as saying there is no measurement error.</li>
<li>The <em>lagged regressions</em> between the within-unit components, using <code>wx2 ON wx1 wy1; wx3 ON wx2 wy2; ...</code>.</li>
<li>Relevant <em>covariances</em> in both the between and within part. In the within part the components at wave 1, and their residuals at waves 2 and further are correlated within each wave, using <code>wx1 WITH wy1; wx2 WITH wy2;...</code>. For the between part we have to specify that the random intercepts are correlated using <code>RIx WITH RIy;</code>.</li>

<h3>Constraints over time</h3>
<p>Imposing constraints to the model can be achieved by giving labels to parameters and using the same label for parameters that you want to constrain to be equal. A label is specified by adding <code>(label)</code> after a parameter. Below we specify a RI-CLPM with the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed auto-regressive and cross-lagged relations over time, <code>(a b c d)</code>,</li>
<li>time-invariant (residual) (co-)variances in the within-person part <code>(cov)</code>, <code>(vx)</code>, and <code>(vy)</code>, and</li>

<h2>Ext. 2: multiple group</h2>
<p>Use the tabs below to navigate to the model specification of the basic multiple-group model, or the model with constrained lagged parameters (and intercepts across groups).</p>
<p>To specify a multiple group RI-CLPM, we need to overrule some of the defaults that Mplus will impose and that are associated with multiple group factor analysis. The reason for this is that when we use the <code>BY</code> statement in combination with multiple groups, Mplus will automatically impose the defaults that are associated with strong factorial invariance (<span class="citation">Meredith (1993)</span>). These defaults are:</p>
<ul>
<li>equal factor loadings across the groups,</li>
<li>equal intercepts for the observed variables across the groups, and</li>
<li>free latent means in the second (and subsequent) group(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of a multiple-group RI-CLPM, the first constraint is not an issue as all the factor loadings are supposed to be constrained to one in both groups. However, the second constraint on the intercepts and the freeing of the latent means in the second group are not sensible here. There will be fewer observed variables than latent variables defined with a <code>BY</code> statement (i.e., a within-unit part for each observed variable, plus a random intercept for each variable); as a result, we would try to estimate more means than that there were observed. Such a model is unidentified. We should therefore overrule the defaults associated with the mean structure. We do this by adding for the second group <code>[x1 x2 ...];</code> which frees the intercepts for the observed variables in the second group. Additionally, we include <code>[wx1@0 wx2@0 ... ]; [RIx@0];</code> for the second group, which ensures all latent means are fixed to zero.</p>
