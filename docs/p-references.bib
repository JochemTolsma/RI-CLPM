abstract = {In recent years, longitudinal data have become increasingly relevant in many applications, heightening interest in selecting the best longitudinal model to analyze them. Too often, traditional practice rather than substantive theory guides the specific model selected. This opens the possibility that alternative models might better correspond to the data. In this paper, we present a general longitudinal model that we call the Latent Variable-Autoregressive Latent Trajectory (LV-ALT) model that includes most other longitudinal models with continuous outcomes as special cases. It is capable of specializing to most models dictated by theory or prior research while having the capacity to compare them to alternative ones. If there is little guidance on the best model, the LV-ALT provides a way to determine the appropriate empirical match to the data. We present the model, discuss its identification and estimation, and illustrate how the LV-ALT reveals new things about a widely used empirical example.},

@article{Bollen2010,
abstract = {Fixed and random effects models for longitudinal data are common in sociology. Their primary advantage is that they control for time-invariant omitted variables. However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models. One is the uncertainty of whether to apply the fixed effects (FEM) versus the random effects (REM) models. Another less discussed issue is that the FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible. For instance, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time rather than be constant as in the usual FEM and REM. The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others. Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary. Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve different estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare. This paper presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases. In addition, it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics. Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models (SEMs) software. The paper is oriented towards applied researchers with most technical details given in the appendix and footnotes. An extended empirical example illustrates our results.},

This article revisits the connection between the univariate and multivariate approaches, elucidating conditions under which they yield the same—or similar—results, and discusses their complementariness. The article is addressed to applied researchers. For those familiar only with the univariate approach, it contributes with conceptual simplicity on goodness-of-fit testing and a variety of tests for misspecification (Hausman test, heteroscedasticity, autocorrelation, etc.), and simplifies expanding the model to time-varying parameters, dynamics, measurement error, and so on. For all practitioners, the comparative and side-by-side analyses of the two approaches on two data sets—demonstration data and empirical data with missing values—contributes to broadening their perspective of panel data modeling and expanding their tools for analyses.

abstract = {Background: The cross-lagged panel (regression) model (CLPM) is the usual framework of choice to test the longitudinal reciprocal effects between self-concept and achievement. Criticisms of the CLPM are that causal paths are over-estimated as they fail to discriminate between- and within-person variation. The random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is one alternative that extends the CLPM by partialling out between-person variance. Aims: We compare analyses from a CLPM and a RI-CLPM which examine the reciprocal relationships between self-concept, self-efficacy, and achievement and determine the extent CLPM estimates are inflated by between-person variance. Sample(s): Participants (n = 314) were first-year undergraduate psychology students recruited as part of the STudent Engagement with Education and Learning (STEEL) project. Methods: Participants completed measures of self-efficacy and self-concept prior to completing fortnightly quiz assessments. Results: Cross-Lagged Panel (regression) Model estimates are likely over-estimated in comparison with RI-CLPM estimates. Cross-Lagged Panel (regression) Model analyses identified a reciprocal effects relationship between self-concept and achievement, confirming established literature. In RI-CLPM analyses, these effects were attenuated and a skill development association between achievement and self-concept was supported. A reciprocal relationship between self-efficacy and achievement was supported. Better model fit was reported for the RI-CLPM analyses. Conclusions: Prior findings relating to the reciprocal effects of self-concept and achievement need to be reconsidered. Whilst such a relationship was supported in a CLPM analysis in this study, within an RI-CLPM framework, only achievement predicted self-concept. However, in both CLPM and RI-CLPM models a reciprocal effects model of self-efficacy and achievement was supported.},

Dutch adolescents (n = 244, Mage = 13.84, 38.50{\%} boys) reported three times on perceived parental privacy invasion and secrecy. Cross-lagged panel models (CLPM) confirmed earlier findings. Privacy invasion predicted increased secrecy, but a reverse effect was found from increased secrecy to increased privacy invasion. Controlling for confounding positive group-level associations with a novel random intercept CLPM, negative within-person associations were found. Higher levels of secrecy predicted lower levels of privacy invasive behaviors at the within-person level. These opposing findings within- versus between-persons illustrate a Simpson's paradox.},

In particular, cross-lagged regression coefficients may vary, depending on the respective time lags between different sets of measurement occasions. This article introduces the concept of an optimal time lag. Further, it is demonstrated that optimal time lags in panel studies are related to the stabilities of the variables investigated, and that in unidirectional systems, they may be unrelated to the size of possible true effects. The results presented also suggest that optimal time lags for panel designs are usually quite short. Implications are (a) that interpreting cross-lagged regression coefficients requires taking the time lag between measurement occasions into account, and (b) that in much research, far shorter time lags than those frequently found in the literature are justifiable, and we call for more "shortitudinal" studies in the future.},

We show that by testing whether there is weak factorial invariance across the trait and state factor structures, we can tackle the fundamental question first raised by Cattell; that is, are within-person state dimensions qualitatively the same as between-person trait dimensions? Furthermore, we discuss how this model is related to other trait-state factor models, and we illustrate its use with two empirical data sets.

We show that these 2 concerns are actually addressing the same underlying issue. We discuss diverse modeling methods based on either multilevel regression modeling with the data in long format, or structural equation modeling with the data in wide format, and compare these approaches with simulated data. We extend the multilevel model with random slopes and discuss the consequences of this. Subsequently, we provide guidelines on how to choose between the diverse modeling options. We illustrate the use of these guidelines with an empirical example based on intensive longitudinal data, in which we consider both a time-varying and a time-invariant covariate.},

We support this claim by reviewing results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, clinical psychology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered-including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's paradox.

abstract = {Multilevel models are becoming increasingly used in applied educational social and economic research for the analysis of hierarchically nested data. In these random coefficient regression models the parameters are allowed to differ over the groups in which the observations are nested. For computational ease in deriving parameter estimates, predictors are often centered around the mean. In nested or grouped data, the option of centering around the grand mean is extended with an option to center within groups or contexts. Both are statistically sound ways to improve parameter estimation. In this article we study the effects of these two different ways of centering, in comparison to the use of raw scores, on the parameter estimates in random coefficient models. The conclusion is that centering around the group mean amounts to fitting a different model from that obtained by centering around the grand mean or by using raw scores. The choice between the two options for centering can only be made on a theoretical basis. Based on this study, we conclude that centering rules valid for simple models, such as the fixed coefficients regression model, are no longer applicable to more complicated models, such as the random coefficient model. We think researchers should be made aware of the consequences of the choice of particular centering options. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Increasingly, social and personality psychologists are conducting studies in which data are collected simultaneously at multiple levels, with hypotheses concerning effects that involve multiple levels of analysis. In studies of naturally occurring social interaction, data describing people and their social interactions are collected simultaneously. This article discuses how to analyze such data using random coefficient modeling. Analyzing data describing day-to-day social interaction is used to illustrate the analysis of event-contingent data (when specific events trigger or organize data collection), and analyzing data describing reactions to daily events is used to illustrate the analysis of interval-contingent data (when data are collected at intervals). Different analytic strategies are presented, the shortcomings of ordinary least squares analyses are described, and the use of multilevel random coefficient modeling is discussed in detail. Different modeling techniques, the specifics of formulating and testing hypotheses, and the differences between fixed and random effects are also considered.},

abstract = {A strong association between functional disability and depressive symptoms in older people has frequently been reported. Some studies attribute this association to the disabling effects of depression, others to the depressogenic effects of physical health-related disability. The authors examined the reciprocal effects between depressive symptoms and functional disability and their temporal character in a community-based cohort of 753 older people with physical limitations who were assessed at yearly intervals. They compared structural equation models that differed in terms of direction and speed of effects between patient-reported disability in instrumental and basic activities of daily living (IADL/ADLs) and depressive symptoms. The association between disability and depression could be separated into three components: (a) a strong contemporaneous effect of change in disability on depressive symptoms, (b) a weaker 1-year lagged effect of change in depressive symptoms on disability (probably indirect through physical health), and (c) a weak correlation between the trait (or stable) components of depression and disability. IADL/ADL disability and depressive symptoms are thus mutually reinforcing over time. Compensatory forces like effective treatment and age-related adaptation may protect elders against this potential downward trend. To improve quality of life in elderly adults, treatment should target disability when it is new and depression when it is persistent.},

Using longitudinal data on middle- and high-school students, the study examines competing arguments regarding the relationship between victimization and offending embedded within the "dynamic causal" and "population heterogeneity" perspectives. The analysis begins with models that estimate the longitudinal relationship between victimization and offending without accounting for the influence of time-stable individual heterogeneity. Next, the victimization-offending relationship is reconsidered after the effects of time-stable sources of heterogeneity, and time-varying covariates are controlled. While the initial results without controls for population heterogeneity are in line with much prior research and indicate a positive link between victimization and offending, results from models that control for time-stable individual differences suggest something new: a negative, reciprocal relationship between victimization and offending. These latter results are most consistent with the notion that the oft-reported victimization-offending link is driven by a combination of dynamic causal and population heterogeneity factors. Implications of these findings for theory and future research focusing on the victimizationoffending nexus are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Inequality constraints are implicitly used in the testing of commonly applied structural equation models, such as the common factor model, the autoregressive model, and the latent growth curve model, although this is not commonly acknowledged. Such constraints are the result of the null hypothesis in which the parameter value or values are placed on the boundary of the parameter space. For instance, this occurs in testing whether the variance of a growth parameter is significantly different from 0. It is shown that in these cases, the asymptotic distribution of the chi-square difference cannot be treated as that of a central chi-square-distributed random variable with degrees of freedom equal to the number of constraints. The correct distribution for testing 1 or a few parameters at a time is inferred for the 3 structural equation models mentioned above. Subsequently, the authors describe and illustrate the steps that one should take to obtain this distribution. An important message is that using the correct distribution may lead to appreciably greater statistical power. {\textcopyright} 2006 APA, all rights reserved.},

To address reciprocal effects, a variety of longitudinal models that include cross-lagged relations have been proposed in different contexts and disciplines. However, the relations between these cross-lagged models have not been systematically discussed in the literature. This lack of insight makes it difficult for researchers to select an appropriate model when analyzing longitudinal data, and some researchers do not even think about alternative cross-lagged models. The present research provides a unified framework that clarifies the conceptual and mathematical similarities and differences between these models. The unified framework shows that existing longitudinal models can be effectively classified based on whether the model posits unique factors and/or dynamic residuals and what types of common factors are used to model changes. The latter is essential to understand how cross-lagged parameters are interpreted. We also present an example using empirical data to demonstrate that there is great},

However, it remains controversial whether energy and non-energy inputs are complements or substitutes. Empirical analysis is conflicting on this issue. This study seeks to explore an alternative way to explain these conflicting results by examining the issue from the perspective of energy efficiency. This study is based on time series data for capital, labor, and energy from 28 Chinese provinces, covering 1985 to 2012. The results show that capital and energy are substitutes in all of the provinces, whereas labor and energy are complements in most of the provinces. Using the threshold effect model, we discover evidence of a threshold point based on the amount of energy efficiency activity in a province. This point separates the substitution behavior of provinces between energy and non-energy inputs. Low-energy efficiency provinces do not substitute as readily as high-energy efficiency provinces. The findings imply that the energy-saving technologies should be applied in provinces with comparatively higher energy intensity because they have more energy conservation potential.},

Therefore, the current study (N = 494, Mage Time 1 = 13.3 years) examined reciprocal within-person longitudinal linkages between adolescents' identity exploration and identity commitment making in the interpersonal and educational identity domains. For this purpose, we constructed a multilevel type cross-lagged panel model from early to late adolescence (i.e., across 5 successive years). Results supported Erikson's (1968) hypothesis that adolescents reconsider current identity commitments and explore alternatives before they make strong commitments within the interpersonal identity domain across early to late adolescence. Within the educational identity domain, increasing identity commitment level and commitment fluctuations predicted less identity reconsideration over time. Our findings support identity theory, but indicate that the processes of identity formation might differ depending on the identity domain.},

Third, it is empirically demonstrated, using Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Models, how distinguishing between-person and within-person associations may alter or strengthen conclusions regarding the links of parental monitoring and adolescent disclosure with adolescent delinquency. Previously detected correlations between parental monitoring and adolescent delinquency were not present at the within-family level. However, there were significant associations between within-person fluctuations in disclosure and delinquency. Together, these models provide stronger evidence for a potential causal link between disclosure and delinquency, but also suggest that previously detected linkages of parental monitoring and delinquency can be explained by stable between-person differences rather than causal processes operating within families.},

abstract = {The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) is believed by many to overcome the problems associated with the use of cross-lagged correlations as a way to study causal influences in longitudinal panel data. The current article, however, shows that if stability of constructs is to some extent of a trait-like, timeinvariant nature, the autoregressive relationships of the CLPM fail to adequately account for this. As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

We illustrate the GCLM by examining the relationship between national income and subjective well-being (SWB), showing how to examine hypotheses about short-run (via Granger-Sims tests) versus long-run effects (via impulse responses). When controlling for stable factors, we find no short-run or long-run effects among these variables, showing national SWB to be relatively stable, whereas income is less so. Our second paper addresses the differences between the GCLM and other methods.

abstract = {Panel data make it possible both to control for unobserved confounders and allow for lagged, reciprocal causation. Trying to do both at the same time, however, leads to serious estimation difficulties. In the econometric literature, these problems have been solved by using lagged instrumental variables together with the generalized method of moments (GMM). Here we show that the same problems can be solved by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation implemented with standard software packages for structural equation modeling (SEM). Monte Carlo simulations show that the ML-SEM method is less biased and more efficient than the GMM method under a wide range of conditions. ML-SEM also makes it possible to test and relax many of the constraints that are typically embodied in dynamic panel models.},
