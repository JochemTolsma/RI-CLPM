### The Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model
The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is rapidly gaining popularity as a structural equation modeling approach to longitudinal data. It allows for the decomposition of observed scores into within-person dynamics and between-person differences. 

Use the top menu to navigate to the Mplus syntax or Lavaan code.

### Extensions and Data
The extensions that are discussed in this project are:

1. including a time-invariant predictor and outcome,
2. doing multiple group analysis, and
3. using multiple indictors for variables. 

You can find the simulated example datasets on [Github](https://github.com/jeroendmulder/RICLPM/tree/master/data).
