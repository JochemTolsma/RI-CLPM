### The Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model
The random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) is rapidly gaining popularity as a structural equation modeling approach to longitudinal data. It allows for the decomposition of observed scores into within-person dynamics and between-person differences. 

This website serves as supplementary material to the paper "*Three extensions of the random intercept cross-lagged panel model with Mplus and Lavaan*" by Hamaker and Mulder (2020). Here, you can find code for specifing the RI-CLPM and numerous extensions in both Mplus and R (using the `Lavaan`-package). Use the top menu to navigate to the Mplus syntax or Lavaan code. You can find the full article at ...

### Extensions
The extensions that are discussed in this project are:

1. Including a time-invariant predictor. 
2. Doing multiple group analysis. 
3. Using multiple indictors for variables.
